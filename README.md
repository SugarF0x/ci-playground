# Sugar CI playground

I've fucked up with CI in production far too many times. Now it's time to fuck around in a controlled environment

This is a Nuxt 3 project that I will be messing around with trying to do versioning, releases,
deployment and whatnot

# Nuxt 3 starter

Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/deployment) for more information.
